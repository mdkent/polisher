- Remaining TODO's, FIXME's, etc
- Syncronization locks needed! (on all shared artifacts, db objects)
- More event handlers, generic handler interface, 
  workflow integration to automatically chain handlers together
- Multiple user support, RBAC and ACL mechanisms
- Project dependencies (w/ versions)
- Integrate mock into build events to build packages in multiple seperate environments
- Use ~/.gem/credentials
