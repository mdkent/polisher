- Remaining TODO's, FIXME's, etc
- Parallelism w/ syncronization locks needed! (on all shared artifacts, db objects)
- More event handlers, generic handler interface,
  workflow integration to automatically chain handlers together
- Generic source download interface, easily be able to download sources via and
  number of mechanisms, and perform pre-release transformations (taring a source
  checkout for example)
